The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has fully loaded. This can happen if you use asynchronous operations that access the snapshot before the `onSnapshot` or `get()` promise resolves. For example, if you call `console.log(doc.data().name)` inside an `onSnapshot` callback before the data is available, it might throw an error.
